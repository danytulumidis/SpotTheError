# SpotTheError

Solidity, Javascript, Typescript and more Code Snippets with errors you have to find!

These will be posted on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danytulumidis) where people can discuss it so we all learn together.

Please feel free to post the solution here or if there is already a solution see if the code can be improved!

## How its organized

Each file will be named in the same way:
